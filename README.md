# Tantares

[Tantares is a (fabulous) parts pack for Kerbal Space Program](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/73686-122-tantareslv-stockalike-n1-and-more-1018122016n1/) (KSP) by Beale. It includes stockalike versions of Soyuz, Salyut, ATK, and other USSR and Russian space craft. TantaresLV includes accompanying launch vehicles.

## Categories

<abbr title="Kerbal Space Program">KSP</abbr> version 1.2 included new part categories. This patch places all Tantares and TantaresLV parts in the correct KSP 1.2 category.

## Old Tantares

For people that play with both the old (pre-GitHub) and new version of Tantares I've created a ModuleManager patch that adds some text to the old parts. The text reads "Part of old Tantares". This is to help you select the newer part in case of duplicate parts, or if you want to transition to only using the newer parts.

## TAC LS

<abbr title="Thunder Aerospace Corporation Life Support">TAC LS</abbr> adds a life support system to KSP.
This means you need to provide (among others) food and water.
This patch adds these resources to a variety of Tantares parts to make life a little easier (see what I did there? Yah, nevermind).
Support for (most) command pods is handled by TAC LS itself.
