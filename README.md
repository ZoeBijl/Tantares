# Tantares

[Tantares is a (fabulous) parts pack for Kerbal Space Program](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/73686-122-tantareslv-stockalike-n1-and-more-1018122016n1/) (KSP) by Beale. It includes stockalike versions of Soyuz, Salyut, ATK, and other USSR and Russian space craft. TantaresLV includes accompanying launch vehicles.

## Categories

<abbr title="Kerbal Space Program">KSP</abbr> version 1.2 included new part categories. This patch places all Tantares and TantaresLV parts in the correct KSP 1.2 category.

## TAC LS

<abbr title="Thunder Aerospace Corporation Life Support">TAC LS</abbr> adds a life support system to KSP.
This means you need to provide (among others) food and water.
This patch adds these resources to a variety of Tantares parts to make life a little easier (see what I did there? Yah, nevermind).
Support for (most) command pods is handled by TAC LS itself.
